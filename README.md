Hello My Name is Henry Ross and I am a Senior in Silver Creek High School.

I have attended IVY Tech for a year and I have found it quite resouceful.
It has taught me a lot for the year of education that I was able to receive. 

I am leaving after high school to serve a two year mission and to help others that are in need of it. 
I wish to attend U of L and get a Bachlors in Compter Porgramming.
